    <b><h1>Obito</h1></b>
    <hr>
    <p>Obito Uchiha (Japanese: うちは オビト, Hepburn: Uchiha Obito),
         also known by his alias Tobi (トビ), 
         is a fictional character and one of the main antagonists in Masashi Kishimoto's manga (and anime adaptation) Naruto, 
        Obito Uchiha’s quotes are heavy with sorrow, but they also carry the weight of hope and redemption.
         His words reflect the struggles of someone who was broken by pain yet still managed to glimpse the light before the end. 
         For fans, 
        his journey is a reminder that even when we make mistakes or walk dark paths, we can always choose differently.</p>

    <b><p>The moment people come to know love, they run the risk of carrying hate.” 
        “You’ll probably have to suffer again from now on… but don’t change.
         Keep going your way.” “When a man learns to love, he must bear the risk of hatred.” 
         “You know, everyone actually shall eventually just end up like me.”</p></b>

    <b>But perhaps more importantly, Obito’s redemption arc reminds us that it is never too late to change.
        His words during his final moments highlight that no matter how far we fall, we still have the power to choose a different ending.
        In this way, 
        Obito reflects a truth many of us face: the balance between despair and hope, darkness and light, giving up and moving forward.</b>
